Building a To-do list application is going to fundamentals of React Js. It is a starter project that would help solidify basic concepts like State, Components, Virtual DOM, JSX, CSS and UX.  

The requested are:
* A textarea and input form, this part takes care of receiving the task which will be rendered to the to-do list component.
* Management Key and Id to storage the tasks in order (without LocalStorage); 
* Buttons to let *"Complete"* or *"Delete"* the task;
* Each task should be given a different color;
* Every complete task will be given a new color to identificate it;
* UX Design is free to build;
  
### *In the project directory, you can run:*

### `npm start`
